Hey, I'm Yan. I graduated with excellence last year at [ELSYS](https://github.com/elsys), specialising in System Programming while working part-time as a Cyber Security Specialist at [SoCyber](https://so-cyber.com). Now I am going all in on my carrer converting my part-time job into a full-time one. I studied English for around 10 years and got my C2 Certificate from Cambridge in 2020. I love coding and as a hobby I do sports or at least try to.
